# SourFileAnalyzer

Source Code Authorship Attribution by extracting layout, lexical and syntactical features and classifying them.

## Dataset
Our dataset contains 9 C/C++ source file/100 user from the Google Code Jam 2015 programming competition [(GCJ_Dataset/Data)](https://github.com/kotunde/SourFileAnalyzer_featureSearch_and_classification/tree/master/GCJ_Dataset/Data), and an average 27 C++ source file/14 user from Sapientia EMTE University [(Sapi_Dataset/Data)](https://github.com/kotunde/SourFileAnalyzer_featureSearch_and_classification/tree/master/Sapi_Dataset/Data).

The main difference between the datasets is that the GCJ users were only given the task to solve, while Sapi users were given the header files too to work with. So the results are more remarkable at the GCJ dataset, since the Sapi codes were similar in structure.
